# HexIsoPath

A 3DS port of the Hexagonal Iso-Path board game by youtuber pocket83 !  
It works as both a .cia and a .3dsx, so people without CFW but access to the HBL can play it!

# License

HexIsoPath is licensed under the MIT license, but includes the currently unlicensed 2D graphics library for 3DS, [pp2p](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/pp2d/) by [BernardoGiordano](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano). More specifically, [this commit](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/pp2d/commit/956aff826fca7f370dc0762ed46ad144e49abaa5).  
It was modified to remove the example, because it was conflicting with the actual game code.

# The game

I often visit [pocket83](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoCEoPxruw9HW58O-l3ttDQ)'s YouTube channel and saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz6q03b8R6U), where he explains how he created the game and how to build it yourself, with different materials.  
Unfortunately, I'm not the manual kind of guy (though I would like to be), but happen to have a 3DS and coding skills. So, I decided to make a 3DS game with the same rules!

# Rules
